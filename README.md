# Squeek!
An Unreal Engine VR Project

## Overview
You find yourself in a maze.  The only way out is to find the cheese.

## Gameplay
The goal is simple.  Find the cheese.

# Source
This is a `git lfs` project.  Be sure you've installed `lfs` before cloning the project.

You will also need the Mobile Starter Content, which is not added to source control. Unreal can add this from the "Add New" button.

### Technical Goals
This is a list of the technical goals I want to achieve.

* Teleportation (comes with the blueprint - easy) - done
* Continuous movement - done
* Snap turning - done
* No sticking heads thru walls to cheat!  Initially, fade to black (not done).  But also push-back (done).
* Random maze generation
* Random placement of goal
* Game restarts on finding goal
* Vive/Rift/Quest support
